  <h1>Books Library</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Christel House has a need to organise the process around cataloging and checking out books from the library. Currently the process is not accurate and does not allow for notifications and reporting on the books library information.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integrate with http rest services for CRUD actions</li>
      <li>Add books through the Google Books API based on ISBN number from book covers</li>
      <li>Add more manual information to each book</li>
      <li>Track learners borrowing of books with a check out system</li>
      <li>Reports to show books that have been checked out</li>
      <li>Chat Bot to interact and conversational search / investigate the database of books</li>

    </ul>
      To change the content of this section, you will make edits to the books.html file located in the /js/views folder.
